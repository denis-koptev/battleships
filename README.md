## Changes

*Shortly describe changes here*

### 26.11.17 (DK)

Added more control points to form ellipse trajectory.

But at this moment all ships are following external ellipse.

Internal ellipse coordinates are in the comment block in Trajectory1->Main 

*Idea: create second center of mass with 1/3 of ships. These ships will follow internal ellipse*
