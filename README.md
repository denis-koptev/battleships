## Changes

*Shortly describe changes here*

### 26.11.17 (DK)

Added more control points to form ellipse trajectory.

But at this moment all ships are following external ellipse.

Internal ellipse coordinates are in the comment block in Trajectory1->Main 

*Idea: create second center of mass with 1/3 of ships. These ships will follow internal ellipse*

### 2.12.17 (DK)

Enabled control points for the internal trajectory.

1/3 of ships will follow these points.

There are 2 centers of mass now.

## Trajectory

## Attack logic (IK)

Ships now can shoot only to ONE nearest enemy ship at the time.

If ship has got 1 health amount, it's going to make TARANUS!
